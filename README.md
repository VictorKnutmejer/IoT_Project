# IoT_Project
My IoT project which uses a DHT11 sensor and some LED lights. This is the code for it.

The dht.py file contains the logic for the DHT11 sensor.

The picoController.py file is the code used for connecting to WiFi and retrieving and sending data from and to adafruit. It also handles the pin connections.
